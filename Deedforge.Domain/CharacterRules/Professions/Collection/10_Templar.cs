In combat, Templars act as the frontline defenders, soaking up damage and protecting their more vulnerable allies.",

As their allies fight alongside them, the Templar might heal any wounded comrades, cleanse them of poisons or curses, and buff them with spells that enhance their strength, speed, or defenses. Overall, Templars are a versatile and powerful class that can make a huge difference in any party, both on and off the battlefield.",
