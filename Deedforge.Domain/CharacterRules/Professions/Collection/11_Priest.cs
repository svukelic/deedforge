They are powerful healers and can use divine magic to bless their allies and smite their enemies. Priests often serve as spiritual leaders in their communities and are looked up to for their wisdom and guidance.

Overall, the priest is a versatile and essential member of any party, providing both spiritual guidance and powerful magic to aid their allies.",
