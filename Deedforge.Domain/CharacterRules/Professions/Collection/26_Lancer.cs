In a party, they serve as the vanguard, leading charges into the heart of enemy formations and wreaking havoc with their devastating cavalry charges. Lancers are renowned for their exceptional horsemanship, and their symbiotic bond with their mounts allows them to execute unparalleled feats of precision and ferocity on the battlefield.",

Their role is to break through enemy lines, disrupting formations and sowing chaos among their foes. With a lance in hand, they can impale multiple adversaries with a single thrust, sending enemies sprawling and creating openings for their allies to exploit. Whether it's charging headlong into the fray, routing enemy cavalry, or executing precision strikes against high-priority targets, the Lancer's role in a party is to be the relentless force of mounted mayhem, turning the tide of battle with each thunderous charge.",
