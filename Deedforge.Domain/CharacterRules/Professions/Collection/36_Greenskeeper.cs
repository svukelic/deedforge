With their innate ability to nurture and manipulate flora, they are invaluable in both cultivating lush gardens and wielding the untamed power of nature against their foes. In a party, Greenskeepers take on the role of both healer and controller, using their mastery over plant life to mend wounds, ensnare enemies, and harness the wild vitality of the natural world.",
            Description2 = "One of the most remarkable abilities of a Greenskeeper is their capacity to command plant growth. They can coax vines to form protective barriers, conjure thorny thickets to impede adversaries, or even shape wood and branches into formidable weapons. Greenskeepers also possess a unique form of healing magic, using the energy of the earth to mend injuries and restore vitality. Their connection to the forests allows them to call upon the aid of woodland creatures, summoning allies such as treants, sprites, and fey spirits to assist their party. Whether they are turning the battlefield into a verdant sanctuary, entangling foes in vines, or bringing forth the wrath of the forest, Greenskeepers are an indispensable asset to any adventuring group seeking to protect the natural world or harness its formidable power.",
