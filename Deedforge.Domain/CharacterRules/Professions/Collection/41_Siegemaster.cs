These masters of siege warfare possess the ability to conjure and control massive siege engines, such as trebuchets, ballistae, and catapults, with uncanny precision. In a party, their role is clear-cut: to break through enemy defenses and create opportunities for their comrades. With the power to reduce towering walls to rubble and breach impenetrable gates, Siegemasters play a crucial role in assaulting fortified positions and ensuring victory on the battlefield.",
            Description2 = "One of the most impressive abilities of a Siegemaster is their expertise in identifying and exploiting the weaknesses of defensive structures. Through careful study and observation, they can discern the structural vulnerabilities of walls, castles, and other fortifications, providing invaluable insights to their party on how to breach or circumvent these defenses. Siegemasters also possess the knowledge to construct makeshift siege engines on the fly, turning the surrounding environment into a weapon. Whether it's creating improvised battering rams or crafting makeshift artillery from found materials, their resourcefulness knows no bounds. With Siegemasters at the helm, a party can transform seemingly impregnable fortresses into conquerable targets, making them essential assets in any campaign of conquest or siege warfare.",
