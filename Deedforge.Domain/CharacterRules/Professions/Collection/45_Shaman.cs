They harness the power of nature through their profound understanding of plants and their potent visions. In a party, Shamans play the roles of healers, mystics, and spellcasters, offering a unique blend of curative abilities and magical prowess.",

Through their vision quests, they can see glimpses of the past, present, and future, offering valuable insights to their comrades. In dire circumstances, a Shaman might brew a potion that grants them the power to briefly step into the spirit world, becoming intangible and immune to harm. Their role in a party is one of versatile support and mystical guidance. They offer vital healing and protective spells, uncover hidden secrets, and tap into the primal forces of nature to turn the tide of battle in their favor. Shamans are often revered as the spiritual pillars of their groups, bridging the gap between the mundane and the supernatural with their unique abilities.",
