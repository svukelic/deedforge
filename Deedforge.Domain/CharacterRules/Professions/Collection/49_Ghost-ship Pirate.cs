These restless entities swarm enemies in combat, overwhelming them with ghostly attacks or dragging them into the eerie depths below. The Ghost-ship Pirate's role in a party is one of eerie intrigue and supernatural power, as they navigate treacherous waters, commune with otherworldly entities, and command a vessel that exists both in the realm of the living and the domain of the dead.
