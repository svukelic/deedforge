            Description1 = "Sandshapers are masters of manipulating earth and sand to their advantage, wielding the very terrain itself as both a weapon and a shield. In a party, their role is that of a versatile terrain controller, capable of shaping the battlefield to their advantage while providing unique support and offensive capabilities to their comrades. With an innate connection to the earth, Sandshapers can alter the very ground beneath their feet, creating barriers, pitfalls, and even launching rock-based projectiles at their foes.",
            Description2 = "On the battlefield, a Sandshaper's mastery over earth magic allows them to create defensive fortifications such as earthen barriers and trenches, providing cover and protection for their allies. They can also disrupt enemy movements by raising sandstorms, obscuring vision and making navigation difficult. In addition to their defensive capabilities, Sandshapers excel at launching powerful earth-based attacks, hurling boulders and shards of rock at opponents with deadly accuracy. When combined with their ability to shape terrain, this makes them formidable adversaries. Furthermore, their deep connection to the earth grants them insight into the secrets of the land, making them skilled trackers and survivalists. In a party, a Sandshaper brings a unique blend of defense, offense, and battlefield control, ensuring that their group always has the upper hand in any encounter where the earth itself is their ally.",

                Description = "You have a magical ability to manipulate sands, using it to both create and destroy. You gain three actions which allow you to summon different sand creations:<br /><br />- Conjure Sand Soldier<br />- Conjure Earthen Barrier<br />- Conjure Sandstorm<br /><br />Each of the three actions, outlined below, grant different effects depending on which type of the Encounter you are in. Once summoned, your sand creations disappear at the start of your next turn.<br /><br />Additionally, when casting Spells, you can choose to make them originate from a location of any of your active sand creations.<br /><br />Conjure Sand Soldier:<br />AP Cost: 1<br />Restriction: Once per turn<br /><br />You conjure a Soldier made out of sand to strike at your enemies. The Soldier is conjured at a location of your choice within Melee vicinity of you, and it follows the Companion rules.<br /><br />The Sand Soldier has Maximum Wounds equal to half of the Proficiency Tier in your Profession Skill, AR equal to 6 + the Proficiency Tier in your Profession Skill, and is summoned with a weapon, two weapons, or a weapon and shield of your choice for which you have at least Trained Proficiency Tier in. The Sand Soldier uses your Profession Skill for all of its Attribute and Skill checks.<br /><br />Combat Encounter. This action also immediately counts as if you took Issue Orders action with your Sand Soldier as the target.<br /><br />Social Encounter. When taking this action, you can also do additional action which reduces the Encounter Complexity. Any action performed by your Sand Soldier also reduces the Encounter Complexity, but only for an amount equal to half its check results.<br /><br />Exploration Encounter. Once per Rest, whenever you or one of your party members takes Recuperate Rest Action or is the target of Treat Rest Action and successfully lose an Injury, you can transfer one Injury of theirs to a temporary Sand Soldier, causing the original target to lose it.<br /><br />Conjure Earthen Barrier:<br />AP Cost: 1<br />Restriction: Once per turn<br /><br />You conjure a Barrier out of the earth to defend you and your allies. Designate any two locations within Near vicinity of you within your line of sight, and which have uninterrupted line of sight between them. The Barrier is conjured in form of a mighty, two-meter-tall wall which connects the two designated locations. If the both of the locations could be considered to be within a Melee vicinity of a specific spot, you can also choose to make the Barrier form a half-circle, with the in-between spot considered as the center of the circle.<br /><br />The Barrier has AR equal to 6 + the Proficiency Tier in your Profession Skill, and Maximum Damage equal to twice the Proficiency Tier in your Profession Skill.<br /><br />Combat Encounter. You can use this action as a reaction whenever an ally of yours within Near vicinity that you can see is targeted by a ranged Weapon or Spell attack, erecting the Barrier between the ally and their would-be attacker. However, the Barrier immediately disappears if used this way.<br /><br />Social Encounter. At the start of your turn, you can choose to maintain any active Barrier. Maximum number of Barriers you can maintain this way is equal to the Proficiency Tier in your Profession Skill.<br /><br />Exploration Encounter. Any time you start a Rest, you can take Fortify Camp Rest Action for free. You use your Profession Skill for any checks made as part of that Rest Action.<br /><br />Conjure Sandstorm:<br />AP Cost: 1<br />Restriction: Once per turn<br /><br />You conjure a furious Sandstorm. The Sandstorm is conjured at a location of your choice within Near vicinity of you that you can see, and it occupies an area within Melee vicinity of the target location.<br /><br />Sandstorm cannot be targeted nor destroyed, but it can be dispersed when affected by sufficiently strong winds, including magical ones.<br /><br />Combat Encounter. Any creature within the area of the Sandstorm is considered to be Blinded, unless they have Tremor Sensitivity.<br /><br />Social Encounter. Any hostile creature within Near vicinity of the Sandstorm is considered to be Frightened of it. Any creature within the area of the Sandstorm is considered to be Stunned.<br /><br />Exploration Encounter. By using your Sandstorm to cover your movements, all members of your party gain Upper Hand on Subterfuge checks done as part of the Sneak Party Action, and taking that Party Action doesn't increase the Exploration DR."
