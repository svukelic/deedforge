            Reactions are special actions that can be taken outside of a character's turn in response to specific triggers or events. A character has limited number of Reactions per Round, which they regain at the start of their turn.
            <br />
            <br />
            Certain features and effects can grant additional Reactions or modify how Reactions work.
            <br />
            <br />
            Reactions can be used to defend against attacks, counter spells, or perform other tasks.

            Attacks are any Actions or Reactions that explicitly seek to harm or negatively affect another character or creature.
            <br />
            <br />
            Attacks strive to reduce the target's Endurance, and can have additional effects or consequences.
            <br />
            <br />
            Unless specified otherwise, Challenge Modifier applied to the attack is equal to the target's Endurance.

        <MudText Typo="@Typo.body1">
            Attack Types are general categories that describe the nature of an attack, and can be affected by various features and effects.
            <br />
            <br />
            Attack Types are:
            <br />
            <br />
            • Melee Attacks
            <br />
            • Ranged Attacks
            <br />
            • Melee Spell Attacks
            <br />
            • Ranged Spell Attacks
            <br />
            • Area Attacks

<MudText Typo="@Typo.h5">
    Opportunities
</MudText>

<br />

<MudText Typo="@Typo.body1">
    Opportunities are special Reactions that can be taken in response to a specific Attack or Action. For example, Fumbled Success on certain Actions will state that the character triggers an Opportunity.
    <br />
    <br />
    When an Opportunity is triggered, the first next enemy character in the Readiness order can take an Opportunity.
    <br />
    <br />
    When a character takes an Opportunity, they can take an Action of their choice - for example, a Move Action or an Attack against the character that triggered the Opportunity. The Attack must be one that the character otherwise could have made. Additionally, certain features may grant additional Actions or effects when a character takes an Opportunity.
    <br />
    <br />
    Opportunities do not count against the character's Reaction limit, and can be used even if the character has already used their Reaction for the Round.
