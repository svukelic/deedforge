    Skill Checks
</MudText>

<br />

<MudText Typo="@Typo.body1">
    Skill Check is a roll made to determine the outcome of an action that requires a degree of skill or knowledge, and which uses a specific Skill.
    <br />
    <br />
    In order to make a Skill Check, you roll a Base Die and a Proficiency Die corresponding to your proficiency in that Skill, and add the results together.
    <br />
    <br />
    However, certain Actions that require a Skill Check may have an opposing force that you need to overcome, in which case you subtract the Challenge Modifier, which is defined by the Action itself, from your final result.
    <br />
    <br />
    Therefore, the formula for a Skill Check is as follows:
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Skill Check Result = Base Die Result + Proficiency Die Result - Challenge Modifier</b>
</MudText>

<br />
<br />

    Resolving Skill Checks & Determining Success Tiers
</MudText>

<br />

<MudText Typo="@Typo.body1">
    The resulting effect of a Skill Check depends on the <b>Success Tier</b>. Your final result falls into one of these Success Tiers:
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>6 and below:</b> Fumbled Success
    <br />
    <b>7-12:</b> Basic Success
    <br />
    <b>13-18:</b> Superior Success
    <br />
    <b>19 and above:</b> Epic Success
    <br />
    <br />
    <i>Additionally, you can choose to take lower Success Tier, should you wish to do so.</i>
</MudText>

<br />
<br />

<MudText Typo="@Typo.h5">
    Critical Rolls
</MudText>

<br />

<MudText Typo="@Typo.body1">
    Whenever you roll a maximum result on a Proficiency Die, it is considered you had a Critical Roll. When that happens, you can choose one of the following effects:
    <br />
    • Roll an additional Proficiency Die and add the result to your check.
    <br />
    • Gain an additional AP for that Turn.
    <br />
    <br />
    Critical Rolls can be triggered only once per Turn.
    <br />
    Certain features may grant you additional effects to choose when you roll a Critical Roll.
</MudText>

<br />
<br />

<MudText Typo="@Typo.h5">
    Increasing Skill's Proficiency Tier
</MudText>

<br />

<MudText Typo="@Typo.body1">
    Whenever a character rolls maximum roll on a Base Die (12) when making a Skill Check, that is considered to be a <b>Breakthrough</b>. A character can have only three Breakthroughs per <MudLink Href="/adventuring/adventures">Adventure</MudLink> (or less, in case of shorter Adventures, as decided by the Guide), and can only have one Breakthrough per Skill per Adventure.
    <br />
    <br />
    When a Breakthrough happens, at the end of either that Sessions or Adventure (as decided by the player), that character gains a <MudLink Href="/character-rules/traits">Trait</MudLink> belonging to the Skill they rolled a Breakthrough in.
    <br />
    <br />
    For every <b>two</b> Traits a character has in a particular Skill, that Skill increases by one Proficiency Tier.
</MudText>

<br />
<br />

<MudText Typo="@Typo.h5">
    Upper & Lower Hand
</MudText>

<br />

<MudText Typo="@Typo.body1">
    When you have Upper Hand on a Skill Check, you reroll the Base Die and take the higher result.
    <br />
    <br />
    When you have Lower Hand on a Skill Check, you reroll the Base Die and take the lower result.
    <br />
    <br />
    Upper Hand and Lower Hand cancel each other out.
    <br />
    <br />
    You may have multiple instances of Upper Hand or Lower Hand on a single Skill Check.
    <br />
    • If you have double Upper Hand, instead of rerolling the Base Die, your Success Tier increases by one.
    <br />
    • If you have double Lower Hand, instead of rerolling the Base Die, your Success Tier decreases by one.

    Knowledge Checks
</MudText>

<br />

<MudText Typo="@Typo.body1">
    Knowledge Checks are Skill Checks that are used to determine how well you know a particular subject tied to a specific Skill.
    <br />
    <br />
    Detailed information about Knowledge Checks can be found in the <MudLink Href="/core-rules/actions-reactions">Actions & Reactions</MudLink> section.
